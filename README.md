　　远处的夕阳睁着蜻蜓般的大眼睛，红霞如翅飞动。
　　痴情女郎回顾录闭幕篇再会了，我的之前你过华诞，我说：此后山川不见面!人海两茫茫。然而真的要走了，我却舍不得。真的，什么人连本人的华诞都忘了。...
　　让我们拿出中国人的精神，日本有武士道精神，中国有女排的精神，抗日战争中国那么艰苦的条件，和日本优越的条件对比，谁会相信我们能把日本鬼子打跑，可是我们真的做到了，要是没有追求幸福生活的精神支柱，和前辈们对胜利坚定的信心，我们怎么能赶走小日本呢！所以，在幸福生活中，难免会有一点磕磕碰碰，这都是人生的必然，也是每个人都要经历的，只有经历风雨才会见才会见彩虹，只有经历坎坷我们才会长大。
This year's summer is more long, dragonflies flying suffering every day, he still don't have the guts to approach my old lover.
Between her and the man murmured, and he and her happy laughter, all obstacles.
His father is a laid-off workers, and his boss is his uncle.
Just had laid off, his father at home like a mad beast, depressed, and the mood is particularly vulnerable, very irritable.
But life is always a killer too much, after 10 years of erosion, now father has become a real peasant.
So the good life, just a little residual in original childhood.
Father is a smoke bag, to smoke, eat can give up, even everything.
I still remember when I was a child, I was the father of smoke choking, as in the past have thrown his packs of cigarettes, on stamping with their feet.
He only that a pack of cigarettes, he was very angry gave me the first face of life.
Also, father's gambling, no bets, he borrowed from me.
He said he won money even give me the money back with interest, the situation of that year, he gambled away all my savings, turning to my coin.
I'm disappointed rejected, the result got second hand in life, this one is too injustice.
This is just the past.
